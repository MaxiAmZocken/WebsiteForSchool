        <h3>What do you need for Web Developement ?</h3>
        <p>
            For Web Developement you don't really need anything special, just
            a basic computer which is able to run coding programs
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What programs should I use for Web Developement ?</h3>
        <p>
            There are many programs for Web Development out there, the most
            used ones are probably 
            <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>, 
            <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and 
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, 
            which we are going to use for the tutorials.

        <h3>Where do I start to create a Website</h3>
        <img src="images/createfiles.png" alt="">
        <p>
            First you want to create a folder to store your websites files,
            you should be creating a "index.html" and a "style.css" file
        </p>
        <img src="images/openfolder.png" alt="">
        <p>
            After you <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Downloaded</a> 
            the VS Code, you have to walk through the introduction, after this
            has been completed, you press "Open Folder..." and choose the 
            Folder you created before.
        </p>
        <img src="images/defaultcode.png" alt="">
        <p>
            Now you can open the "index.html" file on the right, type in "!"
            and press ENTER, this creates a default html file for you
        </p>
        <img src="images/websitetitle.png" alt="">
        <p>
            In the code that just popped up you can change the title, which
            is "Document" by default to the title your website should have
        </p>
