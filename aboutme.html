        <h3>Who am I ?</h3>
        <p>
            My Name is Maxi, I'm a student in Germany and I really enjoy
            developing Websites, this is why I created this website 
            to help others getting started with their coding journey
        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="anchor" id="Start"></div>
        <h3>How did I start ?</h3>
        <p>
            I started developing Websites with a friend of mine using 
            <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>, which technically 
            writes css code for you, this code can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/maxiamzocken/old-website">here</a>. Right
            after I decided to start learning about HTML and CSS on my own and 
            with using the Internet for help.

            <a href="https://github.com/maxiamzocken/maxiamzocken.github.io">here</a></b>.
            This is how the main page looks like :

        <h3>Eurotruck Company Website</h3>
        <p>
